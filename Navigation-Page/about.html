    <h1>About us</h1>
    <article class="main__article">
        <p>Since 1903, Ford Motor Company has put the world on wheels. From the moving assembly line and the $5 workday,
            to soy foam seats and aluminum truck bodies, Ford has a long heritage of progress. Learn more about the
            automobiles, innovations and manufacturing that have made the blue oval known around the world.</p>

        <p>Throughout its 117-year history, Ford has stepped up and made contributions in times of need. From bombers to
            incubators, vehicles are not the only items to come out of Ford plants.</p>

        <p>Ford is the first American-based auto manufacturer to make a century’s worth of its archival assets available
            to the public online. The collection inside the Heritage Vault spans Ford’s production history from the
            Company’s founding in 1903 to its centennial in 2003. While touring the vault, enthusiasts, journalists, and
            other Ford fans can create a collection of materials to download for their own personal use.</p>

        <p>Our founder was a champion of innovation. Learn more about the tinkerer who started it all.</p>
